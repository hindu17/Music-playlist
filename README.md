Music Playlist App
A beginner-friendly React-based music playlist application that allows users to:

Add new songs to the playlist
Navigate between songs using Next and Previous buttons with wrap-around logic
Click on any song title to jump directly to it
Remove songs from the playlist dynamically
View which song is currently active

This project is built using React hooks like useState, with clean and simple UI using inline CSS. It's an excellent demonstration of basic state management, list rendering, and user interaction in React.
